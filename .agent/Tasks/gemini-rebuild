## Rebuild thoughts

## 1. want to have a geometric background instead of a solid color
## 1.1 want to have more phone sizes to choose from in dropdown. 
## 1.2 want to have "phone" removed from the preview and just see the actual immage. 

## 2. want to have an actual ai component to generate the/
 size of the font to fill from 1/4 down from top and 1/4 up from bottom. 
## 2.1 can provide API key for AI component. 

## AFTER REBUILD 2
the most important part of the project, to keep the top 1/4 and bottom 1/4 of the screen clear failed. need to fix that before moving on. need to be sure that the ai can process the blank spaces. 

## REBUILD 3
    if nano banana pro is able to do this, then want to take this all the way. instead of just pasting in a verse and selecting a font and background. i want the AI to first, on a lower priced model, (within the ide session) generate 100 different background images and tag them with appropriate tags for future generation. this should save on time and costs. 
    the 'alt text' of the text box will contain a prompt to paste a verse or ask for an inspirational quote. if a verse is provided, then jump to the creation of the image. if a quote is requested, then a lowerprice llm, openAI mini or something, can generate a quote which will then be passed to the nano banana pro to generate the image. the previous llm will choose which image for NBP to use. 
    so, the LLMs will be (all lowcost, except NBP; am agnostic on which llm to use) 
        1. determine whether the entered text is a verse or quote or a request for a generated one. 
        2. if a verse is provided, select an image and move to final step. 
        3. if a quote or verse is requested, then generate one, select an image and move to final step. 
        4. using NBP, generate the image using the dimensions provided. 
## Notes
    the image generation process can wait for now. continue to use present ones available. will consider how to best implement this in the future.
