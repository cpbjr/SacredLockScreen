## Rebuild thoughts

## 1. want to have a geometric background instead of a solid color
## 1.1 want to have more phone sizes to choose from in dropdown. 
## 1.2 want to have "phone" removed from the preview and just see the actual immage. 

## 2. want to have an actual ai component to generate the/
 size of the font to fill from 1/4 down from top and 1/4 up from bottom. 
## 2.1 can provide API key for AI component. 

## AFTER REBUILD 2
the most important part of the project, to keep the top 1/4 and bottom 1/4 of the screen clear failed. need to fix that before moving on. need to be sure that the ai can process the blank spaces. 

## REBUILD 3


### STOP AFTER HERE. CAN MOVE TO NEXT STEPS WHEN READY

## 3. want to have a nano banana pro font generated by ai
